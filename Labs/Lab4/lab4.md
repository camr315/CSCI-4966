### Why is it important to choose a license?
  License are important because they dictate how a program or project can be used.  Licenses can protect a project from being used freely, or protect a project from losing freedoms.  Licenses are different for proprietary software and for free software, and all users must follow the license or face potential litigation if caught breaking it.
