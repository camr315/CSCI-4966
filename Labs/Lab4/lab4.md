### Why is it important to choose a license?
  License are important because they dictate how a program or project can be used.  Licenses can protect a project from being used freely, or protect a project from losing freedoms.  Licenses are different for proprietary software and for free software, and all users must follow the license or face potential litigation if caught breaking it.

### Why SHOULDN'T you use a project that doesn't hae an explicit license?
  Projects without a license have an implicit copyright on them, so you cannot be sure if the owner is ok with you using it unless you get explicit permission first.  And due to the copyright, the owner of the license could decide to revoke any access s/he has given to people and force their code to be removed from other projects.  Without a license on a project, anyone who is not the author has no legal right to be able to use and change the project code.

### Web vs Gopher
  Yes, I agree with the articles claim on why the Web beat out Gopher.  The largest issue of not including the community in a greater number of decisions and gopher's eventual fall due to forking and no single gohper forked project gaining enough ground has the most credibility.  The gopher community increased its community involvement too late in the game, so it did not garner the support it needed.

### .NET and MIT License
  .NET Core uses the MIT License, as it was originally used as a desktop framework in Windows.  It was made cross platform and cross architecture so that anyone could use it to build what they want with the framework.  Since it was made cross platform with the desire for anyone else to use it, the MIT license works best.  The license allows anyone to use .NET Core, for both commercial and private use.  With the license, anyone can access and edit the source code and build their own projects using the framework.  Which aligns with the goals desired from releasing .NETCore to the public.

### GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD: which one is better - for a developer, for a company, for the common good
  GPL works best for the common good, LGPL works best for a developer, and Apache/BSD works best for a company.  GPL works best for the common good as it requires all changes to the code also have the GPL license.  This means that the community will always be able to use all code made for this project for this project or for other projects.  LGPL is best for a developer because, like GPL, changes to the source code of the project must be under LGPL, however, projects and applications that use the library with the LGPL license do not need to be LGPL.  This gives a developer the most options for what s/he wants to do with the project.  It could be made for commercial use or public and private use.  Apache/BSD is best for a company, as Apache contains a patent license from contribuors and BSD include a BSD copyright.  These protect the company's work in the project and requires anyone who uses it to ensure the company gets proper credit for their work.

### Choosing a Project
  I would use the MIT License for the project so that anyone who finds or uses it has free range to edit and change the code to best suit their needs and purposes, allowing for greater and easier change to the code for those with needs other than the project currently allows for.
