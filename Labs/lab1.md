  is and remains open source software.  The lienses must also allow free redistribution, access to the source code, and the ability
  to modify the code.

### Free Culture Chapter 3
  The chapter demonstrates the importance of open source software.  If the software designed in the search engine was open source, then Jesse would have been protected and never would have been able to be accused of piracy.  Seeing as Jesse did not modify the search engine to return music results, he was not at fault.  Proper licensing would have protected him from what had transpired.  The big takeaway from the chapter is licensing.  Always make sure that what you're using has licensing that would prevent you from getting in trouble, especially if you plan to let your software be used a broader public.

## Reflection
  To find a problem that interests me, I've been looking thorugh the provided index and selecting and reading up on projects that are potentially interesting or whose names grab my attention.  So far I've read the section on the Battle for Wesnoth, SQLAlchemy, and Blockcode.  I then looked up those projects further to find more information than what was written in their respective chapters and sections.  I have not finished deciding which project I am most interrested in, as both Wesnoth and SQLAlchemy piqued my interest further.  I've always enjoyed videogames, so Wesnoth is naturally interesting.  SQLAlchemy is interesting because of my time working with SQL databases over the past few summers and my time working with and teaching Python as a CS1 mentor.  Since I have not yet worked with databases and python together, it could be a much more interesting project to look up.
