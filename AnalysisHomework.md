| Language               |      2      | Python, one of my preferred languages to use                                                                                                                                     |
| Level of Activity      |      1      | Created at the beginning of the year, so not possible for it to be active during all 4 quarters                                                                                  |

| Project Size           |      1      | Not sure how large the project should be or will get, but seeing as its still growing, the 1844 lines seems reasonable                                                           |
| Issue Tracker          |      0      | No tracked issues in the entire history of the project                                                                                                                           |
| New Contributor        |      0      | Empty ReadMe file and no other indicator of instructions for new contributors                                                                                                    |
| Community Norms        |      1      | No stated code of conduct, but no bad behavior either                                                                                                                            |
| User Base              |      0      | Project still under start up development, so definitely only the dev team contributing                                                                                           |
| Total Score            |     8/20    | Needs some work, but as the dev team is small and doing this as part of a small student run project, the shortcomings of this project are understandable in the current context. |
