### NightScout
As NightScout is a collection of projects/respoitories, I used their cgm-remote-monitor for my table.

## Part 2 Analysis
What is NightScout? NightScout is a free and open source software project that allows users to store data from continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in the cloud.  NightScout allows a CGM to be hooked up to a phone, which will then transmit the data to a database.  This allows parents of children with type 1 diabetes to remotely monitor their children’s glucose levels by setting up a website to display the data.  This allows a parent to see their child’s glucose levels while the child is at school, or while the child is otherwise away from both parents.  Parents can use NightScout to allow their younger children to be alone in the house, or to go on sleepovers, or participate in other activities where the need for monitoring of glucose levels could hinder the child’s ability to participate.  An example of this is that parents can feel uncomfortable with allowing their child to spend the night away from them, as if their glucose levels drop too low while sleeping, the child could quietly pass into a coma and then die a few hours later.  Since NightScout will upload and display a child’s glucose levels to the internet, a parent can check their child’s levels remotely.  This makes a parent feel more comfortable with sending their child off to a sleepover.  NightScout is on Github at https://github.com/nightscout, and they also have a website that details set up process and other features at http://www.nightscout.info.
I scored NightScout a 15/18.  It has a GPL license, many contributors, and they remain active with updates and issue trackers.  The community who uses the product is also fairly expansive, and you can find with relative ease people helping others install and use it for their own needs.  There is even a website for the technologies and projects (URL above) that further assists people in finding and working with the technology, as well as explaining how it works.  The only problem with the website is that aspects of it are a little outdated, which is why community and new users are set to 1 point instead of 2.  NightScout also has many different projects than just the cgm-monitor, to assist in other areas to assist in the same and similar goals with different technologies.  They have projects to set up the monitors with androids and iPhones, as well as being able to set it up on smart watches.  As such, the community is very large and very active, as people have banded together to help create and code the same functionality into multiple different systems.  The project size received a 2, but since I have no idea what should constitute a 2, I would also be comfortable with a 1.  Since there are so many different projects under the single NightScout scope, I feel as if it is likely that some form of code base will exist for any new or improved functionality someone may want to give this project.
Why is this project appealing?  As this project assists parents of children and people with type 1 diabetes, I am naturally interested in this project.  Type 1 has run in my family, and while it often appears later than childhood in my family, that connection to this project makes it interesting and something to keep an eye on.  It seems as if interacting with the community would be very helpful and useful.  The project was born when some developers couldn’t gain access to similar technology as it was considered inaccurate for medical use.  So they worked on and created the NightScout project. They grew the community, and I believe the community grew out of a similar desire to be helpful and improve lives.  So the community is very nice and helpful to work with.  The people are very helpful and do their best to make sure new users are accommodated for.  The fact that the people in the project are helpful is very good, since the project page itself doesn’t have the best information on setting up the project for your own use.
