1) History/evolution.  Connection to copyright/property laws
	Richard Stallman and the principles of free software.  He created copyleft and the first GNU General Public License.  Jesse Jordan getting sued by the RIAA for his search engine at RPI.  Linus Torvaldis started Linux, a free software operating system.  Creating the Open Source Label: Eric S. Raymond helped describe/spread the word.  Christine Peterson coined the term.  Both were at a free software strategy session.

2) Definition, 4 freedoms, 10 characteristics
	Def:
		Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
		
	4 Freedoms:
		0. Freedom to run the program as you wish.
		1. Freedom to study the source code of the program and then change it so the program does what you wish.
		2. Freedom to help your neighbour. That’s the freedom to redistribute the exact copies of the software when you wish.
		3. Freedom to contribute to your community. That’s the freedom to distribute copies or modified versions when you wish.
		
	10 Characteristics:
		1. Free Redistribution
			The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

		2. Source Code
			The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

		3. Derived Works
			The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

		4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
			The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

		5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
			The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

		6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
			The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

		7. Distribution of License
			The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

		8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
			The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

		9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
			The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

		10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral
			No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
			
3) Characteristics of permissive open source vs copyleft open source
	Copyleft:
		The code can be freely distributed, but all deriviative works made from or using a piece of code must use the same license.
	
	Permissive: 
		The code can be freely distributed, but all deriviative works made from or using a piece of code can use other licenses, including propietary.
